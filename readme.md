# Learning RQ, Reddis, and Kafka
#### Will be building different apps or project depending on requirement to understand above mentioned Message_Queues_and_Data_Streams



## Rabbit MQ using Pika
#### POC to check what RQ Offers 

- For understand RQ better, we will be building event driven system of instagram
- not interacting with database, just assuming everything is working as expected and just trigger the event
- and it should log or print at the consumer end.
- Might write test cases or Fast API app for this.
